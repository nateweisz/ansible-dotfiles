## BEFORE YOU BEGIN
I have attempted the following troubleshooting suggestions:
- [ ] The issue persists when using Firefox in [Troubleshoot Mode](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/diagnose-firefox-issues-using-troubleshoot-mode).
- [ ] Disabled DNS-level content blocking (AdGuard Home, NextDNS, Control D, RethinkDNS, PiHole, etc), [cleared my DNS cache](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-flush-your-dns-cache), and used my ISP's DNS resolver (if applicable).
- [ ] [Cleared website data](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), restarted Firefox, and my issue persists.
- [ ] I have created a [new profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles). The issue persists when using the current [user.js](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/blob/master/user.js) file on GitHub. (Must be in a new profile and a new user.js!)
